    "\n",
    "## 1 Python Environment\n",
    "Before we start doing fancy things with python 🐍, we've got to install in a way that's easy to use and configure. This [blog post](https://hackernoon.com/reaching-python-development-nirvana-bb5692adf30c) has saved me many hours and headaches over the years, so we are going to follow it to install your interpreter and package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Windows Subsystem for Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "_This is for windows users, if you use macOS please skip to [pyenv](#1.2-Pyenv)._\n",
    "\n",
    "macOS was gifted terminal, windows is stuck with powershell. Let's fix that using the [windows subsystem for linux](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WSL), which allows you to run an ubuntu terminal on your windows machine. This means you'll be able to execute Linux binaries and use unix package managers such as [apt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the steps in this [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Pyenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) so that we don't later get confused by 769876234 different python interpreter versions installed on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "Copy paste each line one by one, and run them in your ubuntu shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash \n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo apt upgrade\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python-openssl git\n",
    "\n",
    "curl https://pyenv.run | bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mac\n",
    "Copy paste each line one by one, and run them in your Terminal shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "brew update\n",
    "\n",
    "brew install pyenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Both\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if the installation was successful by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pyenv --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "☑️ It should return something like `pyenv 1.2.17`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "#### global\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've got `pyenv`, you can use it to install a fresh python interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following in your Ubuntu or Terminal shell to install python 3.8.2:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pyenv install 3.8.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to set our machine's global python version to 3.8.2 too:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pyenv global 3.8.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check if that worked:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "☑️ The last command should return `Python 3.8.2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "💪 Try to install python 3.7.7, switch your global version to 3.7.7, and check that it worked using `python --version`. Don't forget to switch back to 3.8.2 afterwards!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### local\n",
    "\n",
    "`pyenv` also allows to set _local_ python interpreter. This can be very useful when running old python 2 applications! Let's try it out. First, go to your home directory (or another if you prefer). \n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# macOS users\n",
    "cd /home/<YOUR_USER_NAME>\n",
    "# windows users\n",
    "cd /mnt/c/Users/<YOUR_USER_NAME>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ℹ️ [`cd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) stands for _change directory_, and is your bread and butter of moving around a file system using the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's create a new directory. Use the [`mkdir`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mkdir) command to do so:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# iml is faster to type than introduction_to_machine_learning...\n",
    "mkdir iml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have to change to that newly created directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "cd iml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can try to set a local python interpreter version by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pyenv local 3.7.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "💪 Try to check if it worked on your own. You can go back to the parent (home) directory using `cd ..`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't particularly want to use an older python interpreter for our `iml` directory, make sure to remove the local version:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "cd iml\n",
    "pyenv local --unset\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ℹ️ Like most other commands and applications, you can find a lot more information about `pyenv` and its usage on its [github](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Pipenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can install [pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) our package & vitual environment manager. Run the following in your shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pip install -U pipenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This installs `pipenv` for your current python interpreter (which in this case should be your global python interpreter 🙂).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check if that worked:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pipenv --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "☑️ This should return something like `pipenv, version 2018.11.26`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's install some packages! One of the best things about python is how many are available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "💪 Go to your `iml` directory, make a new directory called `test`, and change to that new directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you are going to two things:\n",
    "* create a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)\n",
    "* import the [emoji](https://pypi.org/project/emoji/) package in this environment\n",
    "\n",
    "And you can do it in one command! Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "pipenv install emoji\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check if this worked by reading the [Pipfile](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46330327/how-are-pipfile-and-pipfile-lock-used):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "open Pipfile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "☑️ In your text editor, you should see a line with `emoji = \"*\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "ℹ️ There's a lot you can do with `pipenv`, check out the [documentation](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html) if you want to know more.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Can you explain why python virtual environments are useful to programmers? Please ask me if this feels unclear\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you now have a healthy, functional python setup!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 IPython\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put this new python setup to good use with some coding. IPython is the go-to interactive shell for python, and perfect for some quick testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "💪 Based on your knowledge of [package installation](#1.5-Packages), install [ipython](https://pypi.org/project/ipython/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then run it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# enter the local virtual environment shell\n",
    "pipenv shell\n",
    "ipython\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "☑️ Your cursor should be on a line like this: `In [1]:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assign a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "a = 'Machine Learning is fun'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then print that variable simply by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ℹ️ There's too many neat ipython tricks to cover in this class, but for those of you who are curious, the [official documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/index.html) is a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import some packages. Some come automatically installed with your python interpreter (try `import this` or `import antigravity`). Some you have to install through `pipenv`, like we have done before for `emoji`. This means we can now import and use that package! Try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import emoji\n",
    "emoji.emojize('Machine Learning is fun :robot_face:')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now print emojis 😎\n",
    "\n",
    "💪 Try using the `emoji` package to add other emojis to your python output. (pro-tip, the `:...:` codes are the same as slack)\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Can you describe the commands and processes that allowed you to use the `emoji` package? Please ask me if this feels unclear\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# to quit the ipython shell\n",
    "exit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks are a fundamental tool for data scientists. This page was written in a notebook! \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook act a little bit like their own even fancier version of an ipython shell, hosted on a web server. This web server can be in the [cloud](https://mybinder.org/), or run locally. Today we'll setup a local jupyter notebook server on your machine. Since this is python, `jupyter` is managed through `pipenv`, and all it takes is a few commands!\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# go to your test directory\n",
    "cd iml/test\n",
    "# install jupyter\n",
    "pipenv install jupyter\n",
    "# enter the virtual environment shell\n",
    "pipenv shell\n",
    "# run the notebook server\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ℹ️ If you are not re-directed to your browser, you should at least see something like this: `http://localhost:8888/?token=**************`. Use that link to open jupyter in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you are running your own jupyter server! \n",
    "\n",
    "I won't write about the basics of notebooks here, since jupyter hosts a wonderful tutorial notebook on [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipython/ipython-in-depth/master?filepath=binder/Index.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "💪 Read the `Notebook Basics` on binder, and use it to create a python 3 notebook in your local jupyter server. Try to run a code cell with `a = 3`, and experiment with a markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Can you remember why notebooks are so popular with data scientists? Please ask me if this is unclear\n",
    "\n",
    "💪💪 Follow this [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-extensions-517fa69d2231) to add some cool features to your notebook server. This includes table of contents, which will come in handy when I share more of these directly as notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4 Git \n",
    "\n",
    "[git](https://git-scm.com/) is a crucial tool for programmers. It facilitates sharing and collaboration of code, files, and resources. I will be distributing course contents using `git` in an effort to familiarize you with it. Today, we'll try to `pull` (a bit like downloading) those resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "_You should have already installed git when setting up [pyenv](#1.2-Pyenv) above. If not, please follow these [instructions](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)._\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's [setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) your git. Run the following commands with your name and email address:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now `clone` the course [_github repository_](https://github.com/camille-vanhoffelen/introduction-to-machine-learning). These terms might seem obscure for now, but they'll become natural when you use git more. This basically means we want to download a copy of the course folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "💪 Go to the course github repository page. You can explore files through your browser, but we want to have a local copy. For this, find the \"Clone or Download\" green button, and copy the url under \"Clone with HTTPS\". Then run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "cd iml\n",
    "git clone THE_HTTPS_CLONE_URL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have the course materials locally! You can check with the `ls` shell command.\n",
    "\n",
    "💪💪💪 The course materials include some [jupyter notebooks](#3-Jupyter-Notebooks). We want to run them locally! Install `jupyter` and a virtual environment using `pipenv` in the `introduction-to-machine-learning` folder. Then, run a local jupyter notebook server, and open the `.ipynb` files through your browser jupyter UI. You should be able to see this very notebook under `lecture1.1` 🙂. I will incorporate live runnable code in future notebooks, so this is the preferred way of reading them during or after class.\n",
    "\n",
