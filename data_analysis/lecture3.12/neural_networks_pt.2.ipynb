    "Today we learned about **neural network optimization**. First, we revisited cost functions and **gradient descent** in the context of a neural network. We then explained how the **chain rule** can calculate derivatives of the cost function with respect to weights of the first few layers. We showed how gradients can be calculated this way by **stepping** through the network in the **reverse** direction. We defined **backpropagation** as the optimization algorithm which computes the gradients. It **caches** and reuses derivative terms to make the calculation more efficient. We could then **define** neural networks as **nested non-linear functions** structured as **layered neurons**, whose weights are optimized using **gradient descent** and **backpropagation**. Finally, we trained a neural network classifier and regressor and analysed their loss curves.\n",
