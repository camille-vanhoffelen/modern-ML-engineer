Instead of seeing the glass half-empty and looking at the outlier detector's mistakes, we should reflect on the task itself. It would have been almost impossible to detect those killer robot images using rule-based algorithms, and our model _accuracy_ was good _enough_ to save the emojis from Skynet.

    "Today, we defined **anomaly detection**, and listed some of its common applications including fraud detection and data cleaning. We then described how to use **fitted Gaussian distributions** to identify outliers. This lead us to a discussion about the choice of **thresholds** and **hyperparameters**, where we went over a few different realistic scenarios. We then used a Gaussian distribution to remove terminator images from an emoji faces dataset. We learned how learning algorithms **fail** and that data scientists must know how to **debug** them. Finally, we used **PCA** to visualize our killer robot detection. \n",
