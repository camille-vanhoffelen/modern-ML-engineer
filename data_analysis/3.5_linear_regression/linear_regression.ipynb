    "\n",
    "Today, we learned about our first supervised learning algorithm: **linear regression**. First, we re-stated the regression task with **mathematical notation**. We then discovered the **cost function**, which measures a model's errors across a dataset. We walked through an example of the **mean squared error cost function** on a toy problem about cats and internet procrastination. 😸 This lead us to defining **linear models** qualitatively and mathematically. We had all the tools to explain **gradient descent**, an iterative numerical method for **minimizing** the cost function. We understood that it's this optimization procedure which allows the model to **learn** the best hypothesis to predict data accurately. Finally, we put this to **practice** by fitting univariate and multivariate sklearn `LinearRegression` models to the World Happiness Report dataset.\n",
