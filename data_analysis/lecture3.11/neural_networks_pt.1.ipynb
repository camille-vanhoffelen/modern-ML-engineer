    "\n",
    "As our machine learning adventure continues, we wish to build neural networks, and must leave our trusted companion, sklearn. 😢 Instead, we will use a deep learning framework: _keras_ 🤠  \n",
    "\n",
    "[Keras](https://keras.io/) is an _API_. It is just a friendly interface to work with neural networks, and doesn't specify the implementations. Therefore, keras must always be used with a _backend_ to do the mathematical heavy lifting (although this will change [soon](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/65736/why-does-keras-need-tensorflow-as-backend)). We will use [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as our keras backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we have to install two new python dependencies: `keras` and `tensorflow`. Just like all the other packages we've used so far, these were already added to the `Pipfile` included in this repo. However, your `pipenv install` might fail during the locking stage, as the last stable pipenv release is [incompatible](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3921) with tensorflow 2.0. To fix this, we must install the latest _beta_ release of pipenv.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this through the `pip` installed on our `pyenv` python interpreter. If these terms are confusing, please check out lecture 1.1 or this [blogpost](https://hackernoon.com/reaching-python-development-nirvana-bb5692adf30c). \n",
    "\n",
    "First, make sure you are **not** inside your pipenv shell. Then, upgrade pipenv to the latest beta release with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -U pipenv==2020.4.1b1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: If `pip` complains at this stage, you might have to install the `wheel` package, which you can do through `pip install wheel`._\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be able to install the `Pipfile` libraries as per usual, by running `pipenv install` in the repo's root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: Tensorflow is huge and has many dependencies. This means the locking stage can take a while, up to ~ 15 minutes. You can always skip locking with `pipenv install --skip-lock` if you are impatient_ ⌛️\n"

The hidden layers _must_ have a non-linear activation function. `sigmoid` is just a synonym of logistic, so we are using a logistic function activation here. The last layer also uses `sigmoid` since we are tackling a _classification task_. We therefore want the last layer to act as a logistic regression model.\n",

    "\n",

This includes the shapes of the weight matrices. i.e keras transforms the _structural_ information we supplied as arguments into the chained _mathematical_ functions we described in the lecture slides. This prevents us from doing linear algebra everytime we want to train a neural network! 😅\n",

    "Today, we learned about classification and regression with **neural networks**. First, we used parallel logistic regression models to create **artificial features**. We chained these **layers** to create powerful **nested operations**. We understood that this framework of chained non-linear operations acted as a **universal function approximator**. These are capable of modeling complex datasets and are called **neural networks**. We represented these models as a graph, and calculated predictions by stepping through its nodes. We defined important NN vocabulary, such as **neurons**, **activations**, **layers**, and **weights**. Finally, we then created empty neural network structures in **keras**, and loaded model weights to solve classification and regression tasks.\n",
