    "The internet contains almost all of our civilization's knowledge. Why don't we just explore that data and use it? In a twist of irony similar to that of the [library of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel), what makes this knowledge so difficult to access is the fact that there is so much information. Being able to summarise, visualize, and explore text data is difficult, because it cannot be numerically aggregated like tabular data (see lecture 2.3 & 2.4). Words are symbols, we need some solutions to get insights into the meaning encoded in their sequences.\n",
